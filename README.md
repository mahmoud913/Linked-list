# Linked Lists

For this assignment, read: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/implementing-a-linked-list-in-javascript/

There are 4 methods listed at the bottom of the article.  The first 2 have been implemented in index.js.  To complete the assignment, implement the last 2 methods from the article in to index.js.

The last 4 lines of index.js log values to the console; you can tell that your code is working if the console outputs those 4 values.

When you're finished, submit the URL to your GitHub repo:
